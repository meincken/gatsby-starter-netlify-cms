  description: >-
    <p>My name is Nick Meincken, I’m a web developer living in West London. I
    live in a cozy house with my wife Gayle and our 2 cats Truffles and
    Toblerone. When I’m not training for my next event, I’m building websites or
    watching movies whilst building websites. I enjoy good food, fine Rum and
    the odd Cuban cigar. We like to travel, and have had many strange and
    amazing adventures around the world including trips into the hot zone of
    Chernobyl as well as Vietnam, Cambodia and Borneo (this is the short
    list).</p>



    <p>I started meincken.com as a portfolio for my photography about 10 years
    ago, which then evolved into my web portfolio but since the incarnation of
    my company (Built By Moustache) this site then didn’t really have a use. So
    I have decided it will be a place for my inane ramblings and work which
    isn’t web related to sit. This will include my art, design and photography.
    Over the next few months I will be sorting through my past photography and
    art to get this all up here.</p>
